A year ago, I start to learn web development. I made that very same query. I received the same amount of results. AndÂ I was overwhelmed. There were so many, and I didn't know which were good and which were bad. I went with the first result. In retrospect, I'm glad I did, not because it was the best, but because I was doing something. However, I'd like to use this post to talk about the most popular resources out there to help beginners know the experiences of someone who was once in their shoe.

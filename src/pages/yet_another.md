People have defined readability in various ways, e.g., in: The Literacy Dictionary, Jeanne Chall and Edgar Dale, G. Harry
McLaughlin, William DuBay. Easy reading helps learning and enjoyment, so what we write should be easy to understand.
While many writers and speakers since ancient times have used plain language, the 20th century brought more focus to
reading ease. Much research has focused on matching prose to reading skills.
    
This has used many successful formulas:
in research, government, teaching, publishing, the military, medicine, and business. Many people in many languages have
been helped by this.
    
## Hello

By the year 2000, there were over 1,000 studies on readability formulas in professional journals
about their validity and merit. The study of reading is not just in teaching. Research has shown that much money is wasted
by companies in making texts hard for the average reader to read. There are summaries of this research; see the links
in this section. Many textbooks on reading include pointers to readability.
